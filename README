Usage:
ruby autocards.rb [name of the pdf file]

Note that this program has pretty heavy dependencies: GTK+ bindings, 
Poppler bindings, the sqlite3 gem and ActiveRecord.

Also note that this was written in about 3 evenings, using 4 unfamiliar
libraries, so code quality is pretty poor. Its working, though.
